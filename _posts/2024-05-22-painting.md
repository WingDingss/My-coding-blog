Creating something rudimentry can have its fun and upsides, as for starters, its your own piece of work, a piece of work that has been uniquely edited and changed by you, and even if it has flaws or various 
downsides, what makes it worthwhile, is the knowledge that you had the power to change and create. Making simple programs is entertaining as it is thoughtful, for me this would be the simple painting program
however, simple is only the start for what could end up as a glorious masterpiece, or a horrible looking eyesore.
