Creating something rudimentry can have its fun and upsides, as for starters, its your own piece of work, a piece of work that has been uniquely edited and changed by you, and even if it has flaws or various 
downsides, what makes it worthwhile, is the knowledge that you had the power to change and create. Making simple programs is entertaining as it is thoughtful, for me this would be the simple painting program
however, simple is only the start for what could end up as a glorious masterpiece, or a horrible looking eyesore.

Above shows the power of testing, a simple painting feature as shown by the green circle and square, also incorporated into a random walker, the white and black snake showing another powerful method of testing,
that being throwing two pieces of works together into one in order to see the outcome, as further into the experimentation, other unexpected outcomes started to occur.

Continuing with the code used at the time, it was later revealed that one specific part of the codeblock was connected to a server, allowing for collaborative interactivity, meaning others could input onto
the canvas if they had the correct naming channel in place.

```
let connection = new WebSocket('wss://cco6006-tomorrows-web-test.glitch.me/');

let dataPoints=[];

let myAppID="DavesApp2"
let isConnected=false

connection.onopen = function () {
    console.log("I am connected to the server");
  isConnected=true
};
```
Here we have the primary snippet of code that would allow other users to interact with the program, this interaction wasnt a huge impact to the program, only visual markers placed where another
users mouse may be, thus the snippet was no removed due to its lesser impact, and due to the fact that it added another factor of chaos into the program.
