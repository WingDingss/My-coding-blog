# P5 Random Walkers
Randomness and unpredicability is something in code and general things that i do enjoy, the ability to still be confined, but to come out with something not thought could be made.
This can be true for random walkers, set pieces of code made to constantly move about on a canvas, leaving behind a trail of whatever the coder made to print out while moving,
these movements can create a variety of unique and interesting designs.
