# P5 Random Walkers
Randomness and unpredicability is something in code and general things that i do enjoy, the ability to still be confined, but to come out with something not thought could be made.
This can be true for random walkers, set pieces of code made to constantly move about on a canvas, leaving behind a trail of whatever the coder made to print out while moving,
these movements can create a variety of unique and interesting designs.

```
let newDir=floor(random(numDirections))
  direction+=(noise(xPos/50, yPos/50, frameCount/100)-0.5)*PI
   let toCentre=atan2(yPos-height/2, xPos-width/2)
   direction+=(toCentre-direction)/20
  step=noise(xPos/230, yPos/230, frameCount/100)*25
  let xStep=cos(direction) * step
  let yStep=sin(direction) * step
  xPrev=xPos
  yPrev=yPos
  xPos+=xStep
  yPos+=yStep
  edges()
```
We can see here the snippet of part of the code demonstrating the randomness and how its calculated, allowing the line to choose what point it wishes to travel at constantly.
For me personally randomness is my favourite part of creative coding, and utilising it at any point i can take in order to see the results is arguably the best part of the creation process, the interesting results
of what had been created. and the mesmerising patterns that can occasionally result from them.

later into developing other programs, the random walker makes a return, this time as a more snake-like creature crossing the canvas yet again, we can see how a random walker can add life and complexity into any program, even if 
they arent necessarily needed as implementing not necessary can always give the best and most intruiging outcome. For this specific code, it ended up providing a form of game, using the paint tool to attempt to fill the canvas
all while the random walker is also expanding, and must try to stop it from gaining land, this type of miniature game is the form of outcomes that i always look forward to when developing and experimenting with code.
