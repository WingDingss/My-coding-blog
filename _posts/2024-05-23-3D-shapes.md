3D shapes i would admit to be the most difficult and rewarding out of all the programs developed and edited, something about a 3D space and the ability to navigate with the mouse around a work truly brings it to the next level in lifeness.
This next stage of creative design does come with its next level of complexity however as stated, due to working with an entirely new axis in the program, it means more code to implement, and more chances of error.
