3D shapes i would admit to be the most difficult and rewarding out of all the programs developed and edited, something about a 3D space and the ability to navigate with the mouse around a work truly brings it to the next level in lifeness.
This next stage of creative design does come with its next level of complexity however as stated, due to working with an entirely new axis in the program, it means more code to implement, and more chances of error.

With the first testing of 3D at the very start of the module, it was very rudimentery due to not knowing what the code actually did and what variables accounted to what, so the start was alot of grabbing code
from the p5 examples and pasting them into a program to see what it would do, which worked with the most part until all the shapes were in the same spot with no way to tell which was what, thats where the variable
delving occured and started to mess with the sizes, width and height which lead to at least something that seemed to be a number of shapes together rotating, after some more tweaking, it then started to look
somewhat humanoid, which i then realised was going to be the goal of this program, to attempt to somehow turn the shapes into a humanoid.

After the initial success of making a humanoid out of 3D shapes, next came the knowledge of moving shapes on their own, a much trickier challenge as now it is where the 3rd dimension comes into play,
however what suprised me during the initial test, is how little code is necessary in order to make shapes move, below is a code snipper of what is necessary to allow 3D objects to move:

```
 translate(0, 0, 550);
  rotateX(-0.3);
  rotateY(-0.2);

  push();
  translate(-15, 0, sin(frameCount / 10) * 200);
  box(30);
  pop();
  push();
  translate(15, 0, sin(frameCount / 5 + PI) * 100);
  cylinder(30);
  pop();
  
  translate(0, 0, 550);
  rotateX(-0.5);
  rotateY(-0.4);

  push();
  translate(-45, 0, sin(frameCount / 10) * 200);
  box(30);
  pop();
  push();
  translate(55, 0, sin(frameCount / 10 + PI) * 200);
  box(30);
  pop();
```

As you can see, very little code was needed, and whilst not everything was understandable at first glanch, upon a detailed view, it begun to make some sense as to how the code was functioning.
However overall most core functions of 3D shapes still remained a mystery, what was important however is some fundamentals were learnt, and could be built upon in order to grasp a better understanding
of other aspects of 3D shapes and implementing them into programs.
