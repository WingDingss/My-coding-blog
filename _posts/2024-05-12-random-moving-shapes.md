Yet another addition into the collection of random code samples, this one instead being about the randomness of shapes, their size, and their positioning, instead of the previous walkers which was a singular
string being randomly moved. The random shapes instead focuses on pure chaos, and my final sample has proven that too much chaos, can cause the PC to suffer
